About context -----------------------------------------------------------------
UserProvider: This component manages the state related to user data and provides it to its child components using the UserContext.Provider. It controls how the data is initialized, updated, and made available to the rest of the application.

UserContext: This is the context object that defines what data is available and how to access it. It's typically exported to allow other components to use it.
